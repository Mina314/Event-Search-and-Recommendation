# Event search and recommendation
I developed an interactive web application using AJAX for real-time event search and ticket purchasing.

This project involved the utilization of Java servlets with RESTful APIs on Apache Tomcat, along with MySQL and MongoDB databases, to capture data from the TicketMaster API. Additionally, it integrated a content-based recommendation algorithm to provide personalized event suggestions.
